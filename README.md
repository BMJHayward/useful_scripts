A place to keep useful stuff for the future.

'bash_to_remember.sh' is just a list of useful linux commands that I don't often use

'CMD_BACKUP.SH' backs up your system

'project_skeleton.txt' makes a project folder, or any folder with all its subfolders and files you could want in one console command

Plus some handy SQL scripts

SQLite_shell.py gives you a cool interactive shell for SQL in python
