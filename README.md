Stuff to use mainly on linux, terminal based tools.

'bash_to_remember.sh' is just a list of useful linux commands that I don't often use

'CMD_BACKUP.SH' backs up your system

'project_skeleton.txt' makes a project folder, or any folder with all its subfolders and files you could want in one console command
